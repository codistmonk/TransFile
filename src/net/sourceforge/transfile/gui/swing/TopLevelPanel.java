/**
 * TopLevelPanels are the highest level components inside SwingGUI. SwingGUI only aggregates
 * TopLevelPanels, and there is bilateral communication between SwingGUI and the individual
 * TopLevelPanels to inform each other of major events.
 * 
 * TopLevelPanels typically encapsulate a particular feature of the application, i.e. the area
 * where the user configures and initiates a connection.
 * 
 * TopLevelPanels should NOT perform any expensive operations in their constructors 
 * and should instead use their onInit() methods for that.
